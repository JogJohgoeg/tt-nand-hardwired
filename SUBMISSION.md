The complete submission and GDS logs are saved locally under the parent workspace's ignored `h2/build/physical_b49b49e/`. GitHub artifacts can expire; keep this saved copy with the eventual order record.

## Cost and schedule / 费用与班次

The public pricing module was re-read on 2026-10-05: €70/tile, €300 standard kit or €100 limited subsidized kit, €15 shipping per kit. [Calculator](https://app.tinytapeout.com/calculator?shuttle=chipfoundry&tiles=4&pcbs=1), [pricing source](https://app.tinytapeout.com/_build/assets/invoice-WoZjomWD.js), [dated snapshot](verification/evidence/pricing_b49b49e.json).

| User choice | Four tiles | Kit | Listed shipping | Budget total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Tiles only | €280 | — | — | **€280** |
| Tiles + one standard kit | €280 | €300 | €15 | **€595** |
| Tiles + one subsidized individual kit, if eligible/in stock | €280 | €100 | €15 | **€395** |

All three choices are **€140 above the original two-tile budget**. A tile-only purchase does not include a physical kit/chip to test. Discount availability and eligibility, taxes, applicable shipping and final checkout total must be checked in the user's order; no order or price reservation has been created. The [official FAQ](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#what-is-a-devkit) explains kit contents.

The [official shuttle list](https://tinytapeout.com/chips/) lists **2026-11-30 closing** and **2027-06-09 estimated shipping** for TTSKY26d, with launch shown as TBD. Check that this shuttle actually accepts the project when opening the portal; no slot has been reserved.

## Procedure after the user's decision / 用户决定后的提交步骤

1. User chooses four tiles and the kit option, and approves the actual checkout total. Current authorization ends before purchase/submission.
2. Open [Create project](https://app.tinytapeout.com/projects/create), sign in with the user's GitHub account and enter `https://github.com/JogJohgoeg/tt-nand-hardwired`. Select **TTSKY26d / SKY130**, confirm four tiles and the kit choice. These account/order actions have not been performed here.
3. Review the imported project fields against the configuration table and the selected build's full commit/run. Complete payment only with the user's approval.
4. Use **Submit a new revision** to attach the verified GDS build. The audited candidate is b49b49e / GDS run 37359561071. Creating or paying for the project alone does not submit the design revision. If the portal selects a newer build after this documentation commit, first confirm that build's four workflows, source hashes and GDS hash; record its own run numbers.
5. Save the project URL/ID, revision commit, GDS workflow/artifact/hash, selected shuttle and tile count, order receipt and final amount. Confirm the portal lists the revision as submitted/accepted. Update the Beads submission task with those facts.
6. Any later design revision needs fresh GDS/tests/formal and an explicit portal revision before the deadline; a GitHub push by itself does not update the tapeout submission.

Procedure follows the [official submission guide](https://tinytapeout.com/guides/advanced-workshop/submit-your-design/) and [build-selection FAQ](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#which-of-my-builds-will-be-submitted-for-fabrication). No payment, project creation or tapeout revision was submitted during this preparation.
